* Add tests:
* test recovery from this and that like the Device tests.

* Test connecting.
* Test no errors upon connecting.
* Test restoring known state.
* Test reading and parsing errors.
* Test all view model commands.
* test switching modes.
* Test getting and setting sense function. 
2700 Demo

* flying:
* on device initialized
	* make sure the device is in the correct state;
