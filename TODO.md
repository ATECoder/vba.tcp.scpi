# TODO

Route:
Fix setting the channel numbers and scan lists depending on the function mode.
with 7700 we have 10 or 20 channels per card
with 7702 with 20 or 40 channels per card.
Check how flying sets the channels and scan lists.


View model:
* Add a Configuration Mode enum: Immediate, External, Continuous
* detect switching configuration modes between 
* issue reset clear whenever switching model. 
* clear last error when switching modes.

Use unit testsTest connecting,
Use before all to determine if tests are inconclusive (i.e., instrument is off).
Test getting and setting sense function.

* Demo:
	Use 2700 to implement all SCPI commands.
	Use trigger system to toggle the trigger source.
	? use trigger system to send the init SCPI message ':INIT ..."
* questions:
  * See if External Trigger Option Button commands can be moved to the 2700 instrument method such as
    Configure External Trigger Monitoring.


* flying:
* on device initialized
	* make sure the device is in the correct state;
	* detect if the device was disconnected. 
	* ensure the 2700 device is set to read after write false.
* issue reset clear whenever switching model. 
* add operation completion queries to settings commands.


## Tests

## Fixes

## Updates
Tests:
* Add unit tests:
	* Add 2700 unit tests:
		* connect on before all
			* determine if Prologix connected
			* how to quickly determine if instrument is connected
		* inconclusive if not connected.
		* use read raw
		* use buffer read
		* use TCP client.
MVVM:
	* use MVVM View Model for the unit test sheet
	* use MVVM View Model for the 2700 sheet.
Upload release to GitHub:
	* add deploy and localize scripts.
	* [release a build artifact asset on git hub]
	* [gh release upload]
	* [gh release create]
